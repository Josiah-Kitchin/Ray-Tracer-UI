# Ray Tracer UI  

**Author:** Josiah Kitchin, Computer Science Student at the University of Oregon  

This is a Java-based UI for interacting with my custom-built ray tracer. The UI allows users to dynamically generate scene descriptions in JSON format, which are then processed by the ray tracer executable to render images. The final rendered image is displayed within the UI.  

## Features  

- **Graphical Interface** for scene creation  
- **Dynamic JSON Generation** for scene descriptions  
- **Integration with Ray Tracer Executable**  
- **Automatic Image Rendering and Display**  

## Dependencies  

- **Java Swing** (for UI components)  
- **Gson** (for JSON serialization)
